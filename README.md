List of my project ideas to make in the future

Easier Ideas:

Give metadata to mp3 file using ACoustID - sort of done with the Deep Learning project.

IMDB find movies/tv shows I'd like

Create sheet music from audio file using machine learning 
  1.  Train machine to recognize basic instruments.
  2.  Train machine to recognize specific notes in general
  3.  Train machine to recognize notes within instruments
  4.  Actively categorize notes in a file with multiple instruments
  
Take picture when people looking at camera and smiling
  1.  Train machine to recognize smile
  2.  Train machine to recognize when people are facing camera
  3.  Place importance on people closer in the photo, to avoid waiting for background people



Melody creator - look at popular melodies in songs (potentially rap beats, examples from music theory, etc) and create new melodies.  Potentially use a RNN and treat it like writing?  If each note got its own character encoding this could be th ebest way to tackle it

Hip-Hop generator:  by (Artist, sub-genre) - pick your choice of: bar, chorus, verse, full song - to be generated in the style of the artist or subgenre you picked.  (Could be hosted online and get popular through r/hiphopheads).  Can use this python library to pull lyrics from AZlyrics - https://pypi.org/project/azlyrics/.
